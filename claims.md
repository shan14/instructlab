What is pended claims?
A pended claim is a claim that needs more information before it can be processed by a health plan or insurance company. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: The claim is missing information, The claim contains incorrect information, The claim doesn't match the insurer's records, and The claim requires manual review.
A claim may also be pending if it's waiting for a premium payment or if a plan is canceled due to nonpayment.
If a claim is pended, the insurer will usually send a letter requesting the additional information. The claim will remain pending until the requested information is received. If the insurer doesn't receive the required information within the specified time frame, the claim may be denied.
